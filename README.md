This is a fully working Calculator, done as the last project of The Odin Project's Foundation course.

I made a point of figuring out the logic of all the operations and the data management by myself, and relied on documentation for understanding how some methods/functions worked (like Math.round and for adding the keyboard compatibility.)

I added all the optional features suggested in the curriculum, and I found it to be very good practice.

I am sure I can still find ways to make the code more efficient and straight to the point, but I am proud of how I've done considering I started this journey a month ago.

I welcome any comment or advice/criticism.
